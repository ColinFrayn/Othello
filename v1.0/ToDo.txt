Improvements
------------
 
- Thinking indicator
  : Also show the progress on ply 2 somehow?
- Board evaluator
  : Only penalise being next to a corner if that corner is empty?
  : Reward edge counters continuously linked to corner pieces (as they are unflippable)
    : Include any other unflippable counters such as corner triangles.
- Clocks
  : Timed games
  : Ignore search depth options
    : Gray it out when timed game is underway
  : Add option to toggle between timed / fixed-depth games
- Move ordering
  : Use last best first. Requires hash table? 
  : History heuristic
  : Killer moves  
- Hash table
  : Is there a way of storing hash table entries rotation-invariantly?
    : Perhaps pick the rotation with (e.g.) the lowest value for white pieces 
      : Can use the R90 board for white.
      : Maybe also store L90 and R180 boards? Will need to store also for black to generate key
